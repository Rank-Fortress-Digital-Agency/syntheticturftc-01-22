        <h2>Why Make the Change</h2>
        <p>When inquiring about a purchase that will have long-term use, it is crucial to be aware of its needs, maintenance, and quality before the investment is made. One of the largest appeals for artificial turf as opposed to grass is the lack of work required for its upkeep. For grass, there is a need for seed distribution, weeding, insecticide, and watering. Turf, on the other hand, only needs the occasional pickup and sand dispersion. After installation, almost all of the work is taken right out of your hands!</p>
        <p>If in need of these less-than-frequent cleanups for your turf, there are <b><a style="color: green" href="https://www.syntheticturftc.com/artificial-turf-maintenance">artificial turf maintenance companies</a></b> that can take that work right out of your hands in the first place! It is not necessary, however, as the upkeep for artificial grass requires minimal time, energy, and money. All around, the cleaning of an occasional spill more than justifies the investment in turf when compared to the continual maintenance needed for a yard of natural grass.</p>
        <br>
        <b>The use of artificial grass has had widespread use across the country as people inquiring realize its economic benefits and environmental profits.</b>

        <h2>What Kind of Cleaning Does Artificial Turf Require?</h2>
        <p>Despite the difference in maintenance for real and artificial grass, there are still some regular cleanings that will help your yard look fresh and new! Even artificial turf picks up pollen, dust, and dirt overtime, so it is important to regularly rinse your turf to rid your yard of these pollutants. Occasionally raking the yard is also beneficial to its upkeep because not only are you removing any twigs, debris, or leaves, but the rake is acting as a brush that volumizes the fibers used to make the turf appear realistic.</p>
        <p>Outside of the occasional raking and rinsing, there is not much maintenance needed. If removing stains and spills, you can create a solution using water and vinegar or soap to remove any oils or colors, but the majority of your upkeep will be with the removal of any surface pollutants.</p>
        <p>So although mowing, weeding, fertilizing, and spraying pesticide are not required to maintain a healthy looking artificial grass yard, there are some regular maintenance needs that should be taken care of.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>How do I clean and maintain my artificial grass?</h2>
        <p>Maintenance of artificial turf is separate from cleaning stains. For the process of removing stains, there is an area of focus that needs to be cleaned and removed. On the other hand, maintenance requires whole-yard work.</p>
        <p>To control the upkeep of your artificial grass, it is important to know what the procedure is for its care, cleanup, and the tools needed for both.</p>
        <p>Just like any yard, before you are able to work on the grass, you need to remove any debris on top (i.e. raking the leaves, brushing away branches, or discarding any other waste polluting the yard). Then, to keep the grass looking fresh and new, disperse silica sand over its surface evenly. After doing so, leave the yard for a couple hours before use.</p>

        <h2>How do you get red wine out of artificial grass?</h2>
        <p>It seems that the older we get, the more common the question of how to clean red wine out of different materials becomes. Who would have known that we would be asking how to get it out of fake grass, though?</p>
        <p>To begin the removal of the stain, try to collect as much of the liquid as possible. Then, fill up a container with hot water and soap. Use this mixture and a scrubbing tool to remove the oils and lift the stain, and repeat until desired result is acquired. This should help to clear the stain, but if still prominent,  consider contacting a professional turf maintenance crew to remove it.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>How do I clean up spilled liquids on my lawn?</h2>
        <p>The cleanup for liquids is similar across the board, but the amount of repetition needed for each is different. Despite the specification of liquid, the process begins with removing as much of the surface liquid as possible. (This is similar to any spill you would have inside as well.) Then, after filling up a bucket with soap and hot water, scrub the affected area with any tool used to clean stained areas.</p>
        <p>Repeat these steps as many times as needed, changing the water, until the area is clear. Sometimes there are deep stains, though, and at that point, it is recommended to relinquish the maintenance to professional tuf cleaners.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>What cleaning products can I use on fake grass?</h2>
        <p>For grass, there are many specific pesticides, fertilizers, and other mixtures that you have to purchase for its upkeep. On the other hand, artificial grass can be cleaned and maintained with natural solutions that you can create using things you have at the house! There are professional cleaning products that you can use, but a water and vinegar or water and liquid soap mixture can get the job done just as efficiently!</p>
        <p>Some of the more professional products, however, are Simple Green Odor Eliminator, Benefect Botanical Decon 20 Disinfectant Cleaner, and Mr Clean Pet Solution. These are all diverse products, and most are geared toward pet cleanup, whether that be on outdoor turf or indoor kitchen floors!</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Overall, it is important to be knowledgeable of what kind of maintenance is needed to have the best quality appearance for your artificial turf. This may consist of occasional raking and rinsing of your yard, but because it is not grass and does not grow, there is no weeding, mowing, pesticide spraying, or fertilizing that needs to be done. If something ever does come up that needs area-specific spot cleaning for a stain of some sort, there are at-home cleaning solutions that can clean that spot, or there are professionals who are equipped to take this stain away quickly.</p>
